Alacritty -> %APPDATA%/alacritty symlinked with .config/alacritty/alacritty.yml
    in order to get mouse events working I had to:
    Rename your original conhost.exe to other names like conhost.exe_bak in C:\Windows\System32\
    Go to Windows Terminal path C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_<VERSION information>\OpenConsole.exe
    e.g.:C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_1.0.1811.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\OpenConsole.exe
    Copy and rename OpenConsole.exe to C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe
    Reopen your alacrity and open wsl then tmux, you can enjoy~
    BTW, please make sure you keep winpty_backend: false in alacrity config.
